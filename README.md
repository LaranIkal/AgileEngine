# Code challenge for Agile Engine

# What does this Perl program do?.

- Asks for an input filename and for a word to search in the file.
- It checks if the file exists, if so, it searches the word inside the file.
- Prints to the console all lines containing the word.

# Prerequisites:

For the program to run you only need pure Perl. 

# Notes:

My intention was to keep it simple and documented.
